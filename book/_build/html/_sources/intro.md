# Welcome to Dataviz Bootcamp

This online book was created for a live data visualization workshop for Sydney University held in May 2022.

This series of Jupyter Notebooks were designed to help learners dive into the basics of Python data visualization using real datasets.

> **How should I use this book?**

If you're new to all this, it's recommended to read this book in sequential order or search for a specific topic using the sidebar.

All code blocks can be executed directly in the browser and additional buttons are available to open up any notebook in Google Colab or in a JupyterLab environment using a technology called Binder.
