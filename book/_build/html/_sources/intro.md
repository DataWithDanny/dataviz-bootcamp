# Welcome to Dataviz Bootcamp

This online book was created for a live data visualization workshop for Sydney University held in May 2022.

All the notebooks were designed to help all readers dive straight into some basic data visualization best practices using real datasets. We will also highlight some common mistakes both beginners and experienced practitioners make when visualising data.

If you're also new to `Python` and want a gentle introduction to the programming language - you're in the right place!

> How to use this book?

If you're new to all this, it's recommended to read this book in sequential order or search for a specific topic using the sidebar.

All code blocks can be executed directly in the browser and additional buttons are available to open up any notebook in Google Colab or in a JupyterLab environment using a technology called Binder.
